# Greek, Greek everywhere
A Greek translation for Question2Answer

##Not even my final form
I am fan of SCRUM (Agile) so my current sprint is about translating to native language

I plan fulfilling my promise in a week, so wait until 7 of June for the awesomness

##You can thank @zakkak
He was the first to translate. I just added the new edition's keys. You can find his work here [zakkak](https://github.com/zakkak/qa-lang-el)
